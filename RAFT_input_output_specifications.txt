Reach Affinity Tool (RAFT) 

Input Format
RAFT requires a comma-delimited text file that includes the following fields (i.e. columns). This reflects the structure of the modified (i.e. appended) Arc Hydro Drainage Line feature class table.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Field Name	Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTID	Sequential integer unique identifier
Arcid		Sequential integer unique identifier
from_node	The network node identifier at which the reach originates
to_node		The network node identifier at which the reach terminates
Shape_Leng	The length of the reach
HydroID		Unique Arc Hydro database identifier
GridID		Unique Arc Hydro database identifier (primary key for joining output tables)
NextDownID	The HydroID of the next downstream neighbouring reach
DrainID		The HydroID of the catchment corresponding to the drainage line
virtual		An integer code that indicates the type of reach: Real Reach = 0; Virtual (Lake) Reach = 1; Virtual Shoreline = 2
UCA		Upstream Catchment Area for the reach (inclusive)
Attribute 1	1st reach attribute
Attribute 2	2nd reach attribute
...
Attribute n	nth reach attribute
*The input attributes should all be range scaled to values between 0 and 1 or 0 and 100 according to the method outlined in Legendre and Legendre (2012). This resolves Euclidean Distance calculation issues when the input variables have different domains (e.g. Temperature 0 to 30ºC; Percent upstream clay geology 0 to 100%; Channel slope 0 to 15%). Null values are not permitted.
 

Output Format
RAFT writes the results to a MS-Excel workbook. The workbook contains 5 worksheets. The contents of each sheet are outlined below:

SegmentReaches: This sheet relates to individual reaches and their attributes. Each record (i.e. row) represents a reach in the network.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Field Name	Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SegmentID	Unique integer segment identifier as assigned by RAFT
GridID		Unique integer reach identifier (foreign key for joining back to spatial data)
Attribute 1	Value of the 1st attribute
Attribute 2	Value of the 2nd attribute
...
Attribute n	Value of the nth attribute
Strahler	Strahler Order
Shreve		Shreve Order
UCA		Upstream Catchment Area
LakeInfluence	Boolean value indicating whether a reach is considered lake influenced, 1 = TRUE; 0 = FALSE
Virtual		Integer code indicating the type of reach: Real Reach = 0; Virtual (Lake) Reach = 1; Virtual Shoreline = 2


SegmentSummaries: This sheet relates to summaries of all the reaches that comprise a segment. Each record (i.e.row) in the table represents a segment cluster. Summary statitics are currently hard-coded as segment means. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Field Name		Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SegmentID		Unique integer segment identifier as assigned by RAFT
min_Attribute 1		Segment minimum of 1st attribute
min_Attribute 2		Segment minimum of 2nd attribute
...
min_Attribute n		Segment minimum of nth attribute
mean_Attribute 1	Segment average of 1st attribute
mean_Attribute 2	Segment average of 2nd attribute
...
mean_Attribute n	Segment average of nth attribute
median_Attribute 1	Segment median of 1st attribute
median_Attribute 2	Segment median of 2nd attribute
...
median_Attribute n	Segment median of nth attribute
max_Attribute 1		Segment maximum of 1st attribute
max_Attribute 2		Segment maximum of 2nd attribute
...
max_Attribute n		Segment maximum of nth attribute
minStrahler		the smallest Strahler order reach within the segment
medianStrahler		the median Strahler order within the segment
maxStrahler		the largest Strahler order reach within the segment
minShreve		the smallest Shreve order reach within the segment
medianShreve		the median Shreve order within the segment
maxShreve		the largest Shreve order reach within the segment
minUCA			the smallest upstream catchment area within the segment
meanUCA			the average upstream catchment area of reaches within the segment
maxUCA			the largest upstream catchment area reach within the segment
LakeInfluence		Boolean value indicating whether a segment is influenced by a lake
Virtual			Integer code indicating the type of segment: Real Segment = 0; Virtual (Lake) Segment = 1; Virtual Shoreline Segment = 2


Neighborhoods: This sheet identifies which size neighbourhood each reach belongs to.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Field Name	Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GridID		Unique integer reach identifier (foreign key for joining back to spatial data)
NeighbourhoodID	Unique neighbourhood identifier


Distances: This sheet contains the global (absolute) and local (relative) Euclidean Distances between reaches within a segment. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Field Name	Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GridID		Unique integer reach identifier (foreign key for joining back to spatial data)
SegmentID	Unique segment identifier
GlobalDistance	The actual attribute Euclidean Distance value of a reach to the other reaches within each segment. The minimum for SLINK, mean for UPGMA or maximum for CLINK.
LocalDistance	The relative (range-scaled) distance of the reach within each segment (0 = most similar and 1 = most dissimilar)


Settings: A summary of all GUI parameters, thresholds and file names used during the analysis.
